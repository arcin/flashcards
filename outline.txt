Model
  - Card Class
  - Objects will be cards containing the definition and correct answer as attributes.
  - Might use in regex to bring in data.
    - period(.) signifies the end of a definition
    - new line breaks (\n) signify the end of a correct answer
    - white space (\s) will signify the end of a card.
